# c-init

## Overview:
The `c-init` tool is a simple project initializer for C programming projects. It automates the creation of a basic project structure, including essential files and directories, to jumpstart the development process.

## Usage:
To utilize the `c-init` tool, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure that Premake is installed on your system. You can download Premake from [Premake website](https://premake.github.io/download.html).

2. **Project Initialization:**
   - Run the `cinit` executable with the desired project name as an argument:
     ```
     cinit <project_name>
     ```
     Replace `<project_name>` with the desired name for your project.

3. **Generated Project Structure:**
   - Upon execution, `c-init` will create the following directory structure:
     ```
     <project_name>
     ├── bin
     │   └── Debug
     │       └── <project_name>
     ├── obj
     │   └── Debug
     │       └── main.o
     ├── src
     │   └── main.c
     ├── cinit.make
     ├── Makefile
     ├── premake5.lua
     ├── README.md
     └── .gitignore
     ```
     - **bin:** Contains the compiled executable file.
     - **obj:** Stores object files generated during compilation.
     - **src:** Houses the source code files.
     - **cinit.make:** Makefile generated by Premake for building the project.
     - **Makefile:** Workspace Makefile generated by Premake.
     - **premake5.lua:** Lua script for Premake configuration.
     - **README.md:** Documentation file providing project information and instructions.
     - **.gitignore:** File specifying patterns to ignore in Git version control.

4. **Customization:**
   - Modify the generated source code files (`src/main.c`) and Premake script (`premake5.lua`) to tailor them to your project requirements.

5. **Building the Project:**
   - Use the provided Makefile or Premake-generated files to build the project.
   - The project supports both debug and release configurations.
   - The resulting executable is placed in the `bin/Debug` or `bin/Release` directory, depending on the configuration.

6. **Further Development:**
   - Consult the project documentation and source code files for additional information and customization options.
